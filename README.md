# Yet another discord bot

Yet another discord bot made with [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org).  
Invite [link.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=923820925651144724&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
## Why ü§î
While using a discord bot on a server, I thought that it would be pretty cool to 
learn how these bots worked.  
So I decided to create a bot of my own, since not only did I
think it was cool, but I would be able to control what features I wanted/didn't want.
## Lessons Learnt üìñ
- What is and how to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- How to write üÖæÔ∏èbject üÖæÔ∏èriented code to make the project more maintainable.
- How to better handle asyncronous code.
- What Javascript promises are.
