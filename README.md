A typescript template for building simple discord bots.
## Why ðŸ¤”

While building my discord bot, I realized that I had crazy spaghetti code and while 
refactoring my code, I realized that I had made an easy to use template for anyone to
make discord bots with. ðŸ¤–
## Usage/Examples

#### Creating a command

**Commands** should be created in the ./src/***commands*** folder.

```javascript
import ICommand from "../interfaces/ICommand";

const command : ICommand = {
    name : "command",
    description : "This is a test command",
    ...
}

export default command;
```

#### Creating an event

**Events** should be created in the ./src/***events*** folder.

```javascript
import IEvent from "../interfaces/IEvent";

const event : IEvent = {
    name: "ready",
    run() {
        console.log("The bot is ready!");
    }
}

export default event;
